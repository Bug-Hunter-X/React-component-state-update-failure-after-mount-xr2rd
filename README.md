This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the incorrect use of lifecycle methods to update component state. The `BuggyComponent.js` file showcases the faulty code, while `FixedComponent.js` offers the corrected version using the recommended `useEffect` hook.  This is a fundamental issue often encountered by React developers when transitioning from older lifecycle methods to the functional component approach.
